# Deep Learning Models

Due to the variety of problems and challenges to be solved, there are a large number of models; most of them are networks of neurons that allow us to address and solve them. Some of the best known and most versatile models are:

| Model | Description | Typical use |
|:------|:------------|:------------|
| Fully Connected Neural Networks (*FCNN*) | Basic deep learning model with all neurons in one layer connected to all neurons in the next layer. | Classification, regression |
| Convolutional Neural Networks (*CNN*) | Model designed to process data with a topological grid structure, such as an image. | Image processing and classification |
| Recurrent Neural Networks (*RNN*) | Model designed to process sequences of data, taking into account the order of the data. | Natural language processing, time series | 
| Autoencoders | Model that learns to copy its inputs to its outputs. It is used to learn the representation of the data. | Dimensionality reduction, generation of new images. |
| Generative adversarial networks (*GAN*) | System of two competing neural networks: one network generates new data and the other evaluates its authenticity. | Generation of new images, super-resolution |
| Transformers | Attention-based model that processes input data in parallel rather than sequentially, improving efficiency. | Natural Language Processing (e.g., BERT, GPT) |

# Implementation

Deep learning models can be implemented using various libraries and frameworks. Some of the most popular are `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.

- **TensorFlow**: Is an open-source library for machine learning developed by Google. It provides a set of tools for developing and training Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. TensorFlow offers high and low level APIs and supports a wide range of algorithms and techniques. In addition, it can be run on multiple CPUs and GPUs, as well as on mobile devices.
- **Keras**: It is a high-level neural network API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with the goal of enabling rapid experimentation and being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. Keras offers the ability to define and train deep learning models with only a few lines of code, and is an excellent choice for beginners.

TensorFlow and Keras are two popular and powerful tools for implementing deep learning models. TensorFlow offers more flexibility and control, while Keras is easier to use and faster to prototype. Since TensorFlow version 2.0, Keras is officially integrated into TensorFlow, which means you can use the high-level features of Keras while maintaining the powerful capabilities of TensorFlow.

In addition to TensorFlow and Keras, there are other libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, Caffe, MXNet, etc., which are also very popular for implementing deep learning models.
